# A Basic Demo of Tableau SDMX-JSON Web Data Connector Using ABS Data

SDMX-JSON WDC Example

A very basic example of using Tableau's WDC to connect to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) SDMX-JSON API, I couldnt find any other reference examples of connectors to the huge ABS dataset so hopefully this will be useful to someone out there!
